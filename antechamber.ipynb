    "+ Tool Confirmation: For any tool that retrieves sensitive or personal information such as location or system settings, the model should always confirm with the user before proceeding with the action. This will ensure user consent and privacy protection. For example, \"Before fetching your current location, would you like to proceed with this request?\"\n",
    "+ Adapt to User Context: In situations involving business or product searches, the model should adapt its suggestions based on the user's past preferences or specified interests. If a user frequently looks for vegetarian restaurants, it could prioritize those in search results. This will enhance the user experience by providing more personalized recommendations.\n",
    "Challenge Idea to Avoid:\n",
    "+ Inconsistent Persona Switching: Avoid instructing the model to switch between vastly different tones or personas in response to each user query. For instance, do not design the model to sometimes respond as a formal customer service agent and at other times as a casual friend. Consistency in persona helps maintain clarity and reliability, like sticking to a personal assistant role throughout the interaction.\"\"\"\n",

[BACKGROUND_INFORMATION] (Track stable details like the venue name, city, event type, and relevant timeline so they can be referenced without re-asking the user.) #Inject Critical, Non-Negotiable Facts# (Treat as fixed: the user is Alex, planning a birthday jazz night at St. James Live! in Atlanta.
